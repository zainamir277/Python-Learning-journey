# Python Learning Journey 🐍

This repository documents my journey of learning Python fundamentals through small practice programs.
Each program focuses on improving logic, condition handling, and input validation.

## Programs Included

### 1. Pass/Fail with Attendance
- Determines pass or fail based on percentage and attendance
- Adds grace attendance if eligibility conditions are met
- Concepts used:
  - Variables
  - User input
  - Arithmetic operations
  - Conditional statements

### 2. Grading System
- Calculates percentage from obtained and total marks
- Assigns grades (A+ to F) based on percentage
- Includes validation for invalid inputs (negative values, zero total marks)
- Concepts used:
  - Input validation
  - Chained comparisons
  - Conditional logic

### 3.Even/Odd System
- Find even/odd number using logic (n%2==0 , true for evens)
- Includes validation for invalid inputs (negative values, zero input)
- Consepts used:
 - Input validation
 - Loops
 - Conditional Statments
### 4.Fibonacci Series
